## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

## Layout

The designs were created to the following widths:

- Mobile: 375px
- Desktop: 1440px

## Colors

- White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%)
- Light gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%)
- Grayish blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%)
- Dark blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%)

## Typography

### Body Copy

- Font size (paragraph): 15px

### Font

- Family: [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)
- Weights: 400, 700

### What I learned

Since I'm still learning HTML and CSS, it's difficult for me to style as closely to the design because I have no idea what to put in my CSS file. In order to center the item and make it responsive, I'm now starting to search on Google and watch tutorials. I learned that practicing seems to be much better to simply watching YouTube videos for talent improvement. This task made me think back on the lessons I had gained while creating it. Also, now is the perfect moment to study GitHub.

### Continued development

In the upcoming projects, I aim to learn more about and improve my skills in HTML, CSS, JS, Flexbox, Grid, Bootstrap, React, and Figma.
